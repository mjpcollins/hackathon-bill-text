would involve undesirable delay,\n\n(b)having regard to the nature of the issues raised in the case, sufficient evidence is available to enable it to come to a decision without a hearing, and\n\n(c)to dispense with a hearing would not be detrimental to the health of the patient.\n\n(3)The Tribunal must, as soon as reasonably practicable, give notice to each party of\u2014\n\n(a)its decision to dispense with a hearing under sub-paragraph (2), and\n\n(b)the earliest time at which it might determine the application or reference in accordance with that sub-paragraph (which must be such as to afford the parties reasonable notice).\n\n(4)Where an application or reference is to be determined in accordance with sub-paragraph (2)\u2014\n\n(a)in rules 4, 15 and 20 of the 2008 Rules, references

(2), and if it does so it must give notice to each party and make such consequential directions as it considers appropriate.\n\n(6)Expressions used in this paragraph and in the 2008 Rules have the same meaning as in those Rules.\n\n13(1)If the President of the Tribunal is temporarily unable to discharge the functions of the office, the President of the Welsh Tribunals may from time to time nominate another legal member of the Tribunal to act as the temporary deputy of the President of the Tribunal for the purpose of discharging those functions generally or certain of them

begun before the end of that period.\n\n15Where, by virtue of paragraph 5, a person has been remanded under section 35(7) or 36(6) for more than 12 weeks in all, the person may not be further remanded under that provision after the end of a period for which that paragraph has effect.\n\n16(1)Paragraph 8(1) continues to apply after the end of a period for which it has effect in relation to any order

the duty under section 18 or 20(1) of CA 2014 does not apply to a local authority if\u2014\n\n(a)the authority notifies the relevant person that it may make a charge for meeting needs under that section, and\n\n(b)the relevant person asks the authority not to meet those needs.\n\n(3)In sub-paragraph (2) \u201cthe relevant person\u201d means\u2014\n\n(a)the person who would be liable to pay any such charge, or\n\n(b)in a case where\u2014\n\n(i)the authority would be meeting the needs of an adult under section 18 of CA 2014, and\n\n(ii)the adult lacks capacity to arrange for the provision of care and support,\n\na person who is authorised under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to arrange for such provision or is otherwise in a position to do so on the adult\u2019s behalf.\n\n8A local authority does not have to comply with any duties imposed by the following provisions\u2014\n\n(a)any regulations made under section 30 of CA 2014 (cases where adult expresses preference for particular accommodation);\n\n(b)section 47(2) of that Act (duty to prevent or mitigate loss or damage to property of adults being cared for away from home).\n\n9Section 62 of CA 2014 (power to meet child\u2019s carer\u2019s needs for support) has effect as if the reference in subsection (1) to having carried out a child\u2019s carer\u2019s assessment were omitted.\nCharging for meeting needs during emergency period\n\n10(1)This paragraph applies where\u2014\n\n(a)at any time during an emergency period, a local authority begins to meet needs under section 18, 19, 20 or 62 of CA 2014,\n\n(b)at that time, the authority would have been entitled to make a charge under section 14 of that Act for meeting any of those needs, but\n\n(c)the authority decided not to carry out an assessment under section 17 of that Act before beginning to meet those needs.\n\nIn this paragraph \u201cemergency period\u201d, in relation to section 18, 19, 20 or 62 of CA 2014, means a period for which paragraph 4, 5, 6 or (as the case may be) 9 of this Schedule has effect.\n\n(2)The local authority is not prevented by that decision from subsequently carrying out an assessment under section 17 of CA 2014 (whether during or after the emergency period) and deciding to make a charge for meeting those needs during that period; and nothing in that section is to be taken to prevent the authority from carrying out such an assessment, even though the authority has already begun to meet, or has met, those needs.\n\n(3)In so far as there is any charge for meeting any needs under section 18 or 19(2) of CA 2014 during the emergency period, the fact that condition 1, 2 or 3 in section 18 of that Act is not met at the time of the making of the charge does not affect anything already done under section 18 or (as the case may be) 19(2) of that Act.\n\n(4)In so far as there is any charge for meeting any needs under section 20(1) of CA 2014 during the emergency period, the fact that condition 1, 2, 3 or 4 in that section is not met at the time of the making of the charge does not affect anything already done under that section.\nCare and support plans etc\n\n11A local authority does not have to comply with any duties imposed by the following provisions of CA 2014\u2014\n\n(a)section 24 (duty to prepare care and support plan or support plan, etc);\n\n(b)section 25 (duties relating to plans);\n\n(c)section 27(1), (4), (4A) and (5) (duty to review plans, etc).\n\nThe reference in paragraph (c) to subsection (4A) of section 27 of CA 2014 is to the subsection treated as inserted by regulation 11 of the Care and Support (Children\u2019s Carers) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/305).\nContinuity of care and support when person moves\n\n12A local authority does not have to comply with

day of move).\n\n13(1)This paragraph applies where\u2014\n\n(a)paragraph 12 has had effect for any period (\u201cthe emergency period\u201d), and\n\n(b)the emergency period has ended.\n\n(2)Section 37 of CA 2014 has effect subject to the modifications in sub-paragraphs (3) to (5).\n\n(3)In subsections (1) and (2)\u2014\n\n(a)any reference to notifying a local authority that an adult intends to move to the area of that authority includes, in the case of an adult who moved to the area of a local authority during the emergency period, a reference to notifying that authority that the adult has moved to that area, and\n\n(b)where a local authority is notified that an adult has moved to the authority\u2019s area by virtue of paragraph (a), the condition in subsection (1)(c) or (as the case may be) (2)(c) is to be disregarded (and accordingly the requirement imposed by subsection (4)(b) does not apply).\n\n(4)In subsection (3)\u2014\n\n(a)the reference to notifying a local authority that an adult intends to move out of accommodation but to remain in the authority\u2019s area includes, in the case of an adult who moved out of accommodation in the area of a local authority during the emergency period, a reference to notifying that authority that the adult has moved out of the accommodation but has remained in that area, and\n\n(b)where a local authority is notified that an adult has moved out of accommodation by virtue of paragraph (a), the condition in subsection (3)(c) is to be disregarded (and accordingly the requirement imposed by subsection (4)(b) does not apply).\n\n(5)In a case where subsection (4)(b) does not apply by virtue of sub-paragraph (3)(b) or (4)(b), subsection (5) has effect as if the reference to having received the notification under subsection (4)(b) were omitted.\n\n(6)The reference in section 38(1) of CA 2014 to the day of the intended move is, in the case of an adult who moved as mentioned in section 37(1)(b), (2)(b) or (3)(b) of that Act during the emergency period, to be read as a reference to the day on which that period ended.\nDischarge of hospital patients with care and support needs\n\n14In Schedule 3 to CA 2014 (discharge of hospital patients with care and support needs), paragraph 3 has effect as if for sub-paragraph (1) there were substituted\u2014\n\n\u201c(1)The relevant authority, having received an assessment notice, must inform the NHS body responsible for the patient\u2014\n\n(a)whether the patient has needs for care and support,\n\n(b)(where applicable) whether a carer has needs for support,\n\n(c)which (if any) of those needs the authority plans to meet, and\n\n(d)how the authority plans to meet those needs.\u201d\nTransition for children to adult care and support\n\n15A local authority does not have to comply with any duties imposed by\u2014\n\n(a)section 2A(2) to (4) or (6) of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 (welfare services: transition for children to adult care and support), or\n\n(b)section 17ZH(2) to (4) or (6) of the Children Act 1989 (section 17 services: transition for children to adult care and support).\nDuties arising before commencement\n\n16(1)A provision of this Part of this Schedule that provides that a local authority does not have to comply with a relevant duty, or modifies a relevant duty of a local authority, applies in relation to duties arising before the commencement day as it applies in relation to duties arising on or after that day.\n\n(2)In sub-paragraph (1)\u2014\n\n    \u201cthe commencement day\u201d, in relation to a provision of this Part of this Schedule, means\u2014\n    (a)\n\n    the day on which that provision comes into force, or\n    (b)\n\n    where on any day the operation of the provision is revived by regulations under section 88(3), that day;\n\n    \u201crelevant duty\u201d means a duty under\u2014\n    (a)\n\n    Part 1 of CA 2014,\n    (b)\n\n    section 2A(2) to (4) or (6) of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, or\n    (c)\n\n    section 17ZH(2) to (4) or (6) of the Children Act 1989. \n\nPeriod within which assessments may be carried out\n\n17(1)Sub-paragraph (2) applies where\u2014\n\n(a)any provision of paragraph 2 or 12 has had effect for any period, and\n\n(b)that period has ended.\n\n(2)In determining for the purposes of any proceedings whether a local authority has complied with its duty to carry out a relevant assessment within a reasonable period, a court must take into account (among other things) the following factors\u2014\n\n(a)the length of any period for which any provision of paragraph 2 or 12 had effect, and\n\n(b)the number of relevant assessments which need to be carried out by the local authority following the end of any such period.\n\n(3)In this paragraph \u201crelevant assessment\u201d means\u2014\n\n(a)a needs assessment under section 9 of CA 2014;\n\n(b)a carer\u2019s assessment under section 10 of that Act;\n\n(c)a determination under section 13(1) of that Act;\n\n(d)an assessment under section 37(6) of that Act;\n\n(e)a child\u2019s needs assessment under section 58 of that

assessments under section 19;\n\n(and accordingly section 20 of that Act (refusal of a needs assessment for an adult) does not apply).\n\n21In the case of any carer who is an adult, a local authority does not have to comply with any duties imposed by\u2014\n\n(a)section 24 of SSW(W)A 2014 (duty to assess the needs of a carer for support), or\n\n(b)any regulations made under section 30 of that Act, so far as relating to needs assessments under section 24;\n\n(and accordingly section 25 of that Act (refusal of a needs assessment for an adult carer) does not apply).\n\n22(1)This paragraph applies in the case of any adult (including an adult who is a carer).\n\n(2)A local authority does not have to comply with any duties imposed by\u2014\n\n(a)section 32(1)(a) of SSW(W)A 2014 (determination of whether needs meet the eligibility criteria),\n\n(b)section 32(2)(b) of that Act (determination of charge), or\n\n(c)any regulations made under subsection (3) of that section.\n\n(3)The English language text of section 32 of SSW(W)A 2014 has effect as if in subsection (1) there were omitted\u2014\n\n(a)in the opening words, the words \u201c, on the basis of a needs assessment,\u201d,

anghenion yn bodloni\u2019r meini prawf cymhwystra,\u201d and \u201c, serch hynny,\u201d.\n\n23Nothing in paragraph 20, 21 or 22 prevents a local authority from carrying out any assessment, or making any determination, it considers appropriate for the purposes of exercising its functions under section 35 or 40 of SSW(W)A 2014 (as modified by paragraphs 26 and 27 of this Schedule).\n\n24(1)Sub-paragraph (2) applies where\u2014\n\n(a)paragraph 20, 21 or 22 has had effect for any period, and\n\n(b)that period has ended.\n\n(2)In determining for the purposes of any proceedings whether a local authority has complied with its duty to carry out a relevant assessment within a reasonable period, a court must take into account (among other things) the following factors\u2014\n\n(a)the length of any period for which paragraph 20, 21 or 22 had effect, and\n\n(b)the number of relevant assessments which need to be carried out by the local authority following the end of any such period.\n\n(3)In this paragraph \u201crelevant assessment\u201d means\u2014\n\n(a)a needs assessment under section 19 of SSW(W)A 2014;\n\n(b)a needs assessment under section 24 of that

during any period for which paragraph 26 or (as the case may be) 27 applies without having carried out an assessment under section 63(2) of that Act.\nDuties to meet needs for care and support\n\n26Section 35 of SSW(W)A 2014 (duty to meet care and support needs of an adult) has effect as if subsection (3)(a) were omitted.\n\n27Section 40 of SSW(W)A 2014 (duty to meet support needs of an adult carer) has effect as if\u2014\n\n(a)in the English language text, for subsection (3) there were substituted\u2014\n\n\u201c(3)Condition 2 is that the local authority considers it necessary to meet the carer\u2019s needs in order to protect the carer from abuse or neglect or a risk of abuse or neglect.\u201d, and\n\n(b)in the Welsh language text, for subsection (3) there were substituted\u2014\n\n\u201c(3)Amod 2 yw bod yr awdurdod lleol yn barnu ei bod yn angenrheidiol diwallu\u2019r anghenion er mwyn amddiffyn yr oedolyn rhag cael ei gam-drin neu ei esgeuluso neu rhag risg o gael ei gam-drin neu ei esgeuluso.\u201d\n\n28(1)For the purpose of determining whether the duty imposed by section 35 or 40 of SSW(W)A 2014 applies to a local authority, any reference in that section to there being no charge under section 59 of that Act includes a reference to there being no charge because the authority has decided not to carry out an assessment under section 63(2) of that Act as a result of paragraph 25(1) above (but see paragraph 30 below).\n\n(2)But the duty under section 35 or 40 of SSW(W)A 2014 does not apply to a local authority if\u2014\n\n(a)the authority notifies the relevant person that it may impose a charge for meeting needs under that section, and\n\n(b)the relevant person asks the authority not to meet those needs.\n\n(3)In sub-paragraph (2) \u201cthe relevant person\u201d means\u2014\n\n(a)the person who would be liable to pay any such charge, except where paragraph (b) or (c) applies;\n\n(b)in a case where\u2014\n\n(i)the authority would be meeting the needs of an adult under section 35 of SSW(W)A 2014, and\n\n(ii)the adult lacks capacity to arrange for the provision of care and support,\n\na person who is authorised under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to arrange for such provision or is otherwise in a position to do so on the adult\u2019s behalf;\n\n(c)in a case where the authority would be meeting the needs of a carer under section 40 of SSW(W)A 2014 and the person cared for by the carer (\u201cP\u201d)\u2014\n\n(i)lacks capacity to decide whether to have the needs met by the provision of care and support to P, or\n\n(ii)where P is a disabled child aged under 16, does not have sufficient understanding to make an informed decision about having the needs met by the provision of care and support to P,\n\na relevant representative.\n\n(4)The following are relevant representatives for the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)(c)\u2014\n\n(a)an authorised person within the meaning of section 41 of SSW(W)A 2014 (see subsection (15) of that section), and\n\n(b)in the case of a disabled child, a person with parental responsibility for the child.\n\n(5)In a case where the local authority would be meeting the needs of a carer under section 40 of SSW(W)A 2014 and the person cared for by the carer is a disabled child aged 16 or 17, the authority may disregard a request for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2)(b) if it is satisfied that it would not be in the disabled child\u2019s best interests.\n\n(6)In a case where the local authority would be meeting the needs of a carer under section 40 of SSW(W)A 2014 and the person cared for by the carer is a disabled child aged under 16, the authority may disregard a request for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2)(b) if it is satisfied that it would not be consistent with the disabled child\u2019s well-being.\n\n29In the case of any adult (including an adult who is a carer), a local authority does not have to comply with any duties imposed by regulations under section 57 of SSW(W)A 2014 (cases where a person expresses preference for particular accommodation).\nCharging for meeting needs during emergency period\n\n30(1)This paragraph applies where\u2014\n\n(a)at any time during an emergency period, a local authority begins to meet needs under section 35 or 40 of SSW(W)A 2014,\n\n(b)at that time, the authority would have been entitled to impose a charge under section 59 of that Act for meeting any of those needs, but\n\n(c)the authority decided not to carry out an assessment under section 63(2) of that Act before beginning to meet those needs.\n\nIn this paragraph \u201cemergency period\u201d means a period for which paragraph 26 or (as the case may be) 27 has effect.\n\n(2)The local authority is not prevented by that decision from subsequently carrying out an assessment under section 63(2) of SSW(W)A 2014 (whether during or after the emergency period) and deciding to impose a charge for meeting those needs during that period; and nothing in that section is to be taken to prevent the authority from carrying out such an assessment, even though the authority has already begun to meet, or has met, those needs.\n\n(3)In so far as there is any charge for meeting any needs under section 35 of SSW(W)A 2014 during the emergency period, the fact that condition 3 in that section is not met at the time of the imposition of the charge does not affect anything already done under that section.\n\n(4)In so far as there is any charge for meeting any needs under section 40 of SSW(W)A 2014 during the emergency period, the fact that condition 3 in that section is not met at the time of the imposition of the charge does not affect anything already done under that section.\nCare and support plans etc\n\n31In the case of any adult (including an adult who is a carer), a local authority does not have to comply with any duties imposed by\u2014\n\n(a)section 54 of SSW(W)A 2014 (care and support

emergency period\u201d), and\n\n(b)the emergency period has ended.\n\n(2)Section 56 of SSW(W)A 2014 has effect in the case of an adult with the modifications in sub-paragraphs (3) to (5).\n\n(3)In subsection (1)\u2014\n\n(a)the reference to a local authority being notified that a person is going to move to the area of another local authority includes, in the case of an adult who moved to the area of another local authority during the emergency period, a reference to being notified that the adult has moved to that area, and\n\n(b)where a local authority is notified that an adult has moved to the area of another local authority by virtue of paragraph (a), the reference to the authority being satisfied that the move is likely to happen is to be disregarded (and accordingly the requirement imposed by subsection (1)(a) does not apply).\n\n(4)In subsection (2)\u2014\n\n(a)the reference to a local authority being notified that a person is going to move to the area of that authority includes, in the case of an adult who moved to the area of a local authority during the emergency period, a reference to that authority being notified that the adult has moved to that area, and\n\n(b)where a local authority is notified that an adult has moved to the authority\u2019s area by virtue of paragraph (a), the reference to the authority being satisfied that the move is likely to happen is to be disregarded (and accordingly the requirement imposed by subsection (2)(a) does not apply).\n\n(5)The reference in subsection (3) to the day the person moves to the area of a local authority is, in the case of an adult who moved to the area of a local authority during the emergency period, to be read as a reference to the day on which that period ended.\nDuties arising before commencement\n\n34(1)A provision of this Part of this Schedule that provides that a local authority does not have to comply with a relevant duty, or modifies a relevant duty of a local authority, applies in relation to duties arising before the commencement day as it applies in relation to duties arising on or after that day.\n\n(2)In sub-paragraph (1)\u2014\n\n    \u201cthe commencement day\u201d, in relation to a provision of this Part of this Schedule, means\u2014\n    (a)\n\n    the day on which that provision comes into force, or\n    (b)\n\n    where on any day the operation of the provision is revived by regulations under section 88(3), that day;\n\n    \u201crelevant duty\u201d means a duty under Parts 3 to 5 of SSW(W)A 2014. \n\nGuidance\n\n35(1)The Welsh Ministers may issue guidance about how local authorities are to exercise functions under Parts 2 to 5 of SSW(W)A 2014 in consequence of the provision made by this Part of this Schedule.\n\n(2)A local authority must have regard to any guidance issued under this paragraph.\n\n(3)A local authority must comply with such guidance issued under this paragraph as the Welsh Ministers direct.\n\n(4)The Welsh

 \u201cthe 2019 Regulations\u201d means the Notification of Deaths Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1112). \n\n(2)Expressions used in this Part of this Schedule and in the 1953 Act have the same meaning as in that Act.\nInformation concerning deaths: England and Wales\n\n2(1)A funeral director is qualified for the purposes of section 16 or 17 of the 1953 Act to give information concerning the death of a person if the funeral director\u2014\n\n(a)is responsible for the arrangement of the deceased\u2019s funeral, and\n\n(b)is authorised by a relative of the deceased to give information concerning the death.\n\n(2)Section 36 of the 1953 Act (penalties for failure to give information) does not apply to a funeral director who provides information in reliance on sub-paragraph (1).\nGiving information other than in person and dispensing with signing the register\n\n3(1)A qualified informant who is required under the 1953 Act to give information about a death or still-birth to the registrar may give the information to the registrar\u2014\n\n(a)by telephone, or\n\n(b)by any other methods specified in guidance issued by the Registrar General,\n\nif the informant is unable to attend before the registrar in person.\n\n(2)The duty of a qualified informant to sign the register in the presence of the registrar does not apply where information is provided in reliance on sub-paragraph (1).\n\n(3)An entry in a register of deaths or a register of still-births for which, by virtue of sub-paragraph (2), no signature is required is to be treated as an entry signed by a qualified

in the execution of a Part 1A order.\n\n(2)A person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.\n\n(3)If\u2014\n\n(a)a person is convicted of an offence under subsection (1), and\n\n(b)the court by which the person is convicted is satisfied that the failure or wilful obstruction constituting the offence has caused premises or things to become infected or contaminated or otherwise damaged them in a material way,\n\nthe court may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, order

during which the Assembly is dissolved or is in recess for more than 4 days.\n\n(7)Subsections (4) and (5) do not\u2014\n\n(a)affect anything done in reliance on the regulations before they ceased to have effect, or\n\n(b)prevent the making of new regulations.\n\n(8)A statutory rule that is made in accordance with subsection (2) may contain regulations that would, but for section 25P(1)(b) and this subsection, be subject to negative resolution.\nGeneral\n25RPowers of entry\n\n(1)An authorised officer has the right (subject to subsections (2) to (4)) to enter any premises at all reasonable

or constable considers that it is necessary to extend the period because it is not reasonably practicable for a public health officer to exercise the functions under paragraphs 9 to 11 before the end of that period, the officer or constable may, with the consent of a relevant officer, extend the period for a further\u2014\n\n(a)24 hours, in the case of keeping by a constable, or\n\n(b)9 hours, in

person under this paragraph only if they consider it is necessary and proportionate to do so\u2014\n\n(a)in the interests of the person,\n\n(b)for the protection of other people, or\n\n(c)for the maintenance of public health.\n\n(7)Where an immigration officer or constable keeps a person at a place under this paragraph, they must inform that person\u2014\n\n(a)of the reason for keeping them,\n\n(b)of the maximum period for which they may be kept (taking into account the effect of sub-paragraph (4)), and\n\n(c)that it is an offence to abscond.\n\n(8)An immigration officer or constable must, before exercising the powers conferred by this paragraph, consult a public health officer to the extent that it is practicable to do so.\nPowers exercisable after assessment\n\n14(1)This paragraph applies where, during a transmission control period\u2014\n\n(a)a person in England has been screened and assessed by a public health officer (under paragraph 10 or

assessed by a public health officer (under paragraph 10 or otherwise) and the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is potentially infectious.\n\n(2)A public health officer may at any time during the transmission control period impose such requirements and restrictions on the person as the officer considers necessary and proportionate\u2014\n\n(a)in the interests of the

to in paragraph 14(2).\n\n(3)The public health officer may, following reconsideration under sub-paragraph (2)\u2014\n\n(a)revoke the requirement to remain or the restriction or specify a different period not exceeding 14 days in relation to it;\n\n(b)substitute a different requirement or restriction under paragraph 14.\n\n(4)If under sub-paragraph (3) the public health officer revokes the requirement to remain or the restriction, the Secretary of State may, if satisfied that the person is potentially infectious, re-impose the requirement or restriction (for the period originally specified).\n\n(5)If before the end of the period specified in relation to a requirement to remain or restriction (under paragraph 14(3) or sub-paragraph (3)(a))\u2014\n\n(a)a public health officer

for the purposes referred to in paragraph 14(2),\n\nthe officer may extend the period for a further specified period.\n\n(6)Except in the case of a requirement referred to in paragraph 14(3)(e) (requirement to remain in isolation), the further period specified under sub-paragraph (5) may not exceed 14 days.\n\n(7)Where the period to which a requirement to remain or restriction under paragraph 14 relates is extended under sub-paragraph (5), a public health officer must review the requirement or restriction at least once in every period of 24 hours.\n\n(8)If on a review under sub-paragraph (7) the public health officer considers that the person is no longer potentially infectious, the officer must revoke the requirement to remain or the restriction.\n\n(9)If on a review under sub-paragraph (7)\u2014\n\n(a)sub-paragraph (8) does not apply, but\n\n(b)the public health officer considers that the requirement to remain or the restriction is no longer necessary and

of the further period specified under sub-paragraph (5)).\n\n16Where a person is required to remain at a place under paragraph 14(3)(d) or (e) the requirement may be enforced\u2014\n\n(a)by a constable or public health officer removing the person to the place;\n\n(b)by a constable or public health officer keeping the person at the place;\n\n(c)if the person absconds, by a constable taking the person into custody and returning them to that place or another place a public health officer may specify.\n\n17(1)A person on whom a requirement or restriction is imposed under paragraph 14 may appeal against it (or against any variation of it or any extension of the period to which it relates) to a magistrates\u2019 court.\n\n(2)On an appeal under this paragraph the court

adult (not being a person on whom powers are conferred under this Part of this Schedule) that the person exercising the power considers to be appropriate, having regard to any views of the child.\n\n(5)Where a power under this Part of this Schedule is exercisable in relation to a child but the child is not accompanied by an individual who has responsibility for the child, the person by whom the power is exercisable must\u2014\n\n(a)if practicable, contact an individual who has responsibility for the child before the power is exercised, or\n\n(b)if that is not practicable, take reasonable steps after the power is exercised to contact such an individual and inform them of any exercise of the power in relation to the child.\n\n(6)Where a child has a right of appeal (see

over;\n\n    \u201cchild\u201d means a person under the age of 18;\n\n    an individual has responsibility for a child\u2014\n    (a)\n\n    if the individual has custody or charge of the child for

infected or contaminated with coronavirus, or\n\n(ii)the screening was inconclusive, or\n\n(b)a person in Northern Ireland has been assessed by a public health officer (under paragraph 75 or otherwise) and the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is potentially infectious.\n\n(2)A public health officer may at any time during the transmission control period impose such

period for a further specified period.\n\n(6)Except in the case of a requirement referred to in paragraph 79(3)(e) (requirement to remain in isolation), the further period specified under

potentially infectious, the officer must revoke the requirement to remain or the restriction.\n\n(9)If on a review under sub-paragraph (7)\u2014\n\n(a)sub-paragraph (8) does not apply, but\n\n(b)the public health officer considers that the requirement to remain or the restriction is no longer necessary and proportionate for the purposes referred to in paragraph 79(2),\n\nthe public health officer may substitute a different requirement or restriction under paragraph 79 (which may not apply beyond the end of the further period specified under sub-paragraph (5)).\n\n81Where a person is required to remain at a place under paragraph 79(3)(d) or (e), the requirement may be enforced\u2014\n\n(a)by a constable or public health officer removing the person to the place;\n\n(b)by a constable or public health officer keeping the person at the place;\n\n(c)if the person absconds, by a constable taking the person into custody and returning them to that place or another place a public health officer may specify.\n\n82(1)A person on whom a requirement or restriction is imposed under paragraph 79 may appeal against it (or against any variation of it or any extension of the period to which it relates) to a court of summary jurisdiction.\n\n(2)On an appeal under this paragraph the court may\u2014\n\n(a)confirm the requirement or restriction (or variation or extension), with or without modification, or\n\n(b)quash the requirement or restriction (or variation or extension).\nChildren\n\n83(1)An individual who has responsibility for a child must, so far as reasonably practicable,

Northern Ireland Policing Board) that the person exercising the power considers to be appropriate, having regard to any views of the child.\n\n(5)Where a power under this Part of this Schedule is exercisable in relation to a child but the child is not accompanied by an individual who has responsibility for the child, the person by whom the power is exercisable must\u2014\n\n(a)if practicable, contact an individual who has responsibility for the child before the power is exercised, or\n\n(b)if that is not practicable, take reasonable steps after the power is exercised to contact such an individual and inform them of any exercise of the power in relation to the child.\n\n(6)Where a child has a right of appeal (see paragraph 82), the right may be exercised by an individual who has responsibility for the child.\n\n(7)For the purposes of this paragraph\u2014\n\n    \u201cadult\u201d means a person aged 18 or over;\n\n    \u201cchild\u201d means a person under the age of 18;\n\n
