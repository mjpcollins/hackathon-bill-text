(c)at the end there were inserted—

“In this subsection “Convention rights” has the same meaning as in the Human Rights Act 1998.”

7(1)For the purposes of sections 18(6) and 20(9) of CA 2014 (meaning of references to there being no charge for meeting needs), a local authority that decides not to carry out an assessment under section 17 of that Act as a result of paragraph 3(1) above is to be treated as having decided not to make a charge under section 14 of that Act (but see paragraph 10 below).

(2)But the duty under section 18 or 20(1) of CA 2014 does not apply to a local authority if—

(a)the authority notifies the relevant person that it may make a charge for meeting needs under that section, and

(b)the relevant person asks the authority not to meet those needs.

(3)In sub-paragraph (2) “the relevant person” means—

(a)the person who would be liable to pay any such charge, or

(b)in a case where—

(i)the authority would be meeting the needs of an adult under section 18 of CA 2014, and

(ii)the adult lacks capacity to arrange for the provision of care and support,

a person who is authorised under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to arrange for such provision or is otherwise in a position to do so on the adult’s behalf.

8A local authority does not have to comply with any duties imposed by the following provisions—

(a)any regulations made under section 30 of CA 2014 (cases where adult expresses preference for particular accommodation);

(b)section 47(2) of that Act (duty to prevent or mitigate loss or damage to property of adults being cared for away from home).

Charging for meeting needs during emergency period

10(1)This paragraph applies where—

(a)at any time during an emergency period, a local authority begins to meet needs under section 18, 19, 20 or 62 of CA 2014,

(b)at that time, the authority would have been entitled to make a charge under section 14 of that Act for meeting any of those needs, but

(c)the authority decided not to carry out an assessment under section 17 of that Act before beginning to meet those needs.

In this paragraph “emergency period”, in relation to section 18, 19, 20 or 62 of CA 2014, means a period for which paragraph 4, 5, 6 or (as the case may be) 9 of this Schedule has effect.

(2)The local authority is not prevented by that decision from subsequently carrying out an assessment under section 17 of CA 2014 (whether during or after the emergency period) and deciding to make a charge for meeting those needs during that period; and nothing in that section is to be taken to prevent the authority from carrying out such an assessment, even though the authority has already begun to meet, or has met, those needs.

(3)In so far as there is any charge for meeting any needs under section 18 or 19(2) of CA 2014 during the emergency period, the fact that condition 1, 2 or 3 in section 18 of that Act is not met at the time of the making of the charge does not affect anything already done under section 18 or (as the case may be) 19(2) of that Act.

(4)In so far as there is any charge for meeting any needs under section 20(1) of CA 2014 during the emergency period, the fact that condition 1, 2, 3 or 4 in that section is not met at the time of the making of the charge does not affect anything already done under that section.

11A local authority does not have to comply with any duties imposed by the following provisions of CA 2014—

(a)section 24 (duty to prepare care and support plan or support plan, etc);

(c)section 27(1), (4), (4A) and (5) (duty to review plans, etc).

The reference in paragraph (c) to subsection (4A) of section 27 of CA 2014 is to the subsection treated as inserted by regulation 11 of the Care and Support (Children’s Carers) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/305).
Continuity of care and support when person moves

12A local authority does not have to comply with any duties imposed by the following provisions of CA 2014—

13(1)This paragraph applies where—

(a)paragraph 12 has had effect for any period (“the emergency period”), and

(b)the emergency period has ended.

(2)Section 37 of CA 2014 has effect subject to the modifications in sub-paragraphs (3) to (5).

(3)In subsections (1) and (2)—

(a)any reference to notifying a local authority that an adult intends to move to the area of that authority includes, in the case of an adult who moved to the area of a local authority during the emergency period, a reference to notifying that authority that the adult has moved to that area, and

(b)where a local authority is notified that an adult has moved to the authority’s area by virtue of paragraph (a), the condition in subsection (1)(c) or (as the case may be) (2)(c) is to be disregarded (and accordingly the requirement imposed by subsection (4)(b) does not apply).

(4)In subsection (3)—

(a)the reference to notifying a local authority that an adult intends to move out of accommodation but to remain in the authority’s area includes, in the case of an adult who moved out of accommodation in the area of a local authority during the emergency period, a reference to notifying that authority that the adult has moved out of the accommodation but has remained in that area, and

(b)where a local authority is notified that an adult has moved out of accommodation by virtue of paragraph (a), the condition in subsection (3)(c) is to be disregarded (and accordingly the requirement imposed by subsection (4)(b) does not apply).

(5)In a case where subsection (4)(b) does not apply by virtue of sub-paragraph (3)(b) or (4)(b), subsection (5) has effect as if the reference to having received the notification under subsection (4)(b) were omitted.

(6)The reference in section 38(1) of CA 2014 to the day of the intended move is, in the case of an adult who moved as mentioned in section 37(1)(b), (2)(b) or (3)(b) of that Act during the emergency period, to be read as a reference to the day on which that period ended.
Discharge of hospital patients with care and support needs

14In Schedule 3 to CA 2014 (discharge of hospital patients with care and support needs), paragraph 3 has effect as if for sub-paragraph (1) there were substituted—
