(a) prohibits specified things being done in the restricted area,
(b) requires specified things to be done by persons carrying on
specified activities in that area, or
(c) does both of those things.
(6) The only prohibitions or requirements that may be imposed are
ones that are reasonable to impose in order—

that place (or any part of it) is or has been the subject of an expedited
order (“the earlier order”), unless the period specified in subsection
(11) has expired.
(10) In subsection (9) the second reference to “an expedited order” is to
be read as including a reference to a public spaces protection order
(made after the day on which this section comes into force) which
neither prohibited nor required anything that could not have been
prohibited or required by an expedited order.
(11) The period specified in this subsection is the period of a year
beginning with the day on which the earlier order ceased to have

identified in the order, or
(b) an increase in the frequency or seriousness of those
activities after that time.
(3) Where a local authority has made an expedited order, the authority
may, at any time before the order is due to expire, reduce the period

grounds that the reduced period will be sufficient having regard to
the degree of risk of an occurrence, recurrence or increase such as is

an order has effect must be published in accordance with
